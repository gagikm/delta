Possible use for this delta program:

A company sends a list of items for sale to its customers. The next day, the
company receives new items and must update the customers. Instead of sending
a whole new list to every customer, the company can create a delta file
using the delta program then send it to the customers. The customers now 
have the old version of the item list and the delta file and using the delta
program, which we assume they already have, they can convert the old item 
list to the new one.
